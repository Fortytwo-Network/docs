### Operating Your Node

The node will remain fully operational until it is terminated by the user or the system restarts. You can minimize the terminal window or switch to other applications â€“ the node will continue running in the background.

### Updating Your Node

The Fortytwo node app automatically updates every time it is launched. When you start the node, the app checks for the latest available version and installs any updates before running.

### Stopping Your Node

Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal window to terminate the node process.

### Help and Support

For any questions or issues, you can access the tech support channel on the official [Fortytwo Discord server](https://discord.gg/fortytwo).

### Performance Considerations

Currently, the node app does not support full load balancing. It is recommended to stop the node app (by closing the terminal) before running resource-intensive applications (e.g., 3D games, video editing, or graphics software) to prevent performance issues.

This does not apply to nodes running on dedicated machines, where the node app runs independently without impacting other tasks.

Future versions will include load balancing, allowing nodes to run alongside other resource-intensive applications without noticeable performance impact.
