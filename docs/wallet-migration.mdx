## Steps to Migrate Your Wallet

<Steps>
  <Step>
   Locate your **old node installation folder**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Inside it, open the `FortytwoNode` subfolder.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Copy the file named: `.account_private_key`
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Go to your **new node installation folder**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Create a subfolder named `FortytwoNode` if it doesn’t already exist.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Paste the copied `.account_private_key` file into the new `FortytwoNode` folder.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **Your new node will now use the same wallet as before. No reactivation or new wallet generation is required.**
</Check>

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS

Hidden files like `.account_private_key` are not shown by default in Finder. To reveal them:

* Open the folder in Finder.
* Press `Command + Shift + .` to toggle hidden file visibility.
* Once you're done copying, press the same keys again to hide hidden files.

### Windows

To view hidden files in File Explorer:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open **File Explorer**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the **View** tab from the top menu.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Show** → **Hidden items**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Hidden files and folders (including `.account_private_key`) will now be visible.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important

* Do **not** share or expose your `.account_private_key` file. It grants full access to your wallet.
* Ensure that the copied file is placed **exactly** in the `FortytwoNode` subfolder of your new node installation directory.
* If you are operating nodes on multiple devices, each must use a **separate wallet** with its **own unique seed phrase** and `.account_private_key` file.
