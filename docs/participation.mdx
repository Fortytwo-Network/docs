## What is the Fortytwo devnet?

The Fortytwo devnet is the first phase in the development of a decentralized, planetary-scale intelligence. It connects community-owned nodes running small language models on consumer devices like PCs and Macs. Each node contributes idle computing power, creating a distributed network that improves as more participants join.

The devnet operates on the Monad testnet, a Layer 1 EVM-compatible blockchain, which serves as the settlement layer. Node performance and participation data are recorded on-chain to ensure transparency and safety.

## Introducing ‘Hitchhiking to AGI’

**Hitchhiking to AGI** is Fortytwo’s devnet launch program, designed to onboard and reward users who help build and test the network. There are two main ways to participate:

### Run a Node

1. Complete the node operator [form](https://tally.so/r/wQzVQk).
2. If selected, you will receive an email with an activation code. You will need to enter this code when setting up your node using the provided instructions.
3. Once your node is successfully running, you will continue to participate in the network and become eligible for additional token drops.

Properly operated nodes will be eligible to earn Fortytwo rewards based on their ongoing participation and performance.

### Spread the Word

* Contribute to the network's growth by sharing posts about Fortytwo and the **Hitchhiking to AGI** program on X
* Create and share dashboards that display Fortytwo’s activities, including node statistics, devnet progress, or community engagement metrics.
* Share your posts and dashboard links in the official [Fortytwo Discord server](https://discord.gg/fortytwo) to have a chance to earn rewards for your contributions.

### Why Join the Devnet?

* **Contribute to the Development of Community-Owned AI**: Help shape the future of decentralized AI and scalable infrastructure.
* **Support the Creation of a Distributed Reasoning Network:** Play a role in the establishment of a decentralized planetary-scale intelligence.
* **Earn Rewards:** Participants will be rewarded with tokens and other incentives for their contributions to the network.
