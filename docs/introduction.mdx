title: "Introduction"
description: "Fortytwo is a decentralized AI protocol designed to address the scalability challenges faced by centralized AI systems. Instead of relying on massive data centers, Fortytwo leverages swarm intelligenceâ€”a network of small AI models running on a distributed set of devices. By tapping into the idle computing capacity of everyday devices, such as personal laptops and desktops, Fortytwo enables a highly scalable and cost-efficient AI ecosystem."

Operating a Fortytwo node means contributing your device's computational resources to the network, helping run these small models and support the inference tasks necessary for decentralized AI. By participating, you not only help enhance the scalability of the Fortytwo network but also earn rewards in the form of Points, based on the resources you provide.

The process of installing and operating a node is straightforward. Once installed, your node will automatically join the network, handling decentralized inference tasks in the background. It works seamlessly without requiring continuous manual intervention, allowing you to passively contribute while benefiting from a community-owned AI infrastructure.

This guide will walk you through the installation and basic operation of a Fortytwo node, ensuring you can easily get started and contribute to the network.
