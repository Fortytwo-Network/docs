**Q: What’s the official FOR contract address (CA)?**

*A: For devnet: [0x22A3d96424Df6f04d02477cB5ba571BBf615F47E](https://testnet.monadexplorer.com/token/0x22A3d96424Df6f04d02477cB5ba571BBf615F47E).*

**Q: I entered my activation code and got an error, what’s wrong?**

*A: If you haven’t used it yet, ping our support team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fortytwo). If you’ve already activated it, just use your private key or recovery phrase to log in.*

**Q: Can I use the same activation code for more than one node?**

*A: No. Invite codes are one-time use only.*

**Q: Can I run a node on CPU?**

*A: Not at this time. We support only GPU-based nodes due to performance requirements.*

**Q: Which model gives the most FOR?**

*A: It depends: machine specs, internet speed, and even current system load. Try a few available models to see what works best on your setup.*

**Q: My MON balance hit zero and hasn't refilled, what now?**

*A: If you used an activation code, your wallet is usually refilled within 24h. If it’s been longer, message us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fortytwo). Reminder: auto-refill works only for wallets tied to activation codes.*

**Q: My FOR earnings have stopped for hours, why?**

*A: This could be due to connection issues, or low request volume in the network. Try restarting the node or switching to a different model. Sometimes it just needs a bit of time. If it's been over 24 hours with no FOR, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fortytwo).*

**Q: Can I run a node without an activation code?**

*A: Yes. Just follow this [quick start guide](/docs/quick-start). With no activation code, you’ll need to manually monitor and top-up MON and FOR balance for your node to work, with 2 MON and 100 FOR required to start the node. Your node will not automatically receive MON refills with no activation code.*
